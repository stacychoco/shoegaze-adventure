	<p>"One day I decided to ditch class, and I was driving around, thinking about being twenty-two with no education, no plan. Everything I had tried had failed, I was broke, and there was all this bullshit. So I was driving through these nice houses, which I just liked to do, and there was this girl basically sunbathing in her front lawn. I parked, just to chill, but I noticed that she was there, and I watched her for a while. It just looked so easy, you know? She must have been nineteen, going to community college, living in this big house with this nice family, and I'm sitting here dwelling on these mistakes that I've made." - George Clarke, singer of Deafheaven </p>
	<p> This album is melancholic, passionate, warm and atmospheric.</p>
